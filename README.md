# **My make-up bag**

## **Objective:**

#### My overall objective for this project is to create a CRUD application with the use of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during our training. 

## **Requirements:**

#### **The requirements for this project are as follows:**

#### * A Trello board (with a kanban template) with user stories,use cases and tasks needed to complete the project.
#### * A database used to store data and the database needs to have at least 2 tables in it,and model a relationship between the tables. 
#### * Clear documentation from a design phase describing the architecture you will use for you project as well as a detailed Risk Assessment.
#### * A functional CRUD application created in Python, following best practices and design principles, that meets the requirements set on my Kanban Board.
#### * Fully designed test suites for the application you are creating, as well as automated tests for validation of the application. You must provide high test coverage in your backend and provide consistent reports and evidence to support a TDD approach.
#### * A functioning front-end website and integrated API's, using Flask.
#### * Code fully integrated into a Version Control System using the Feature-Branch model which will subsequently be built through a CI server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine.



## **Tech Stack:**

#### **The tech stack required would be the following:**

#### *Kanban Board: Trello or an equivalent Kanban Board
#### *Database: GCP SQL Server or other Cloud Hosted managed Database.
#### *Programming language: Python
